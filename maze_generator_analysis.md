**Algorithm Descriptions:**

For each algorithm, the corresponding class and a description of its mechanics are provided below:

1.  **AldousBorderGenerator (Aldous-Broder Algorithm)**:
    *   **Mechanics**: Starts at a random cell and marks it as part of the maze. It then performs a continuous random walk. If the walk moves to a cell that has not yet been visited (is a wall), it carves a path to it (marks the neighbor and the wall between them as path) and adds the neighbor to the maze. This process continues until all cells in the grid have been visited. This algorithm produces a uniform spanning tree but can be slow as it may revisit many cells multiple times before finding an unvisited one.

2.  **BacktrackingMazeGenerator (Recursive Backtracker/DFS)**:
    *   **Mechanics**: This algorithm uses a stack to keep track of visited cells. It starts at a random cell, marks it as visited, and pushes it onto the stack. While the stack is not empty, it looks at the current cell (top of the stack). If the current cell has any unvisited neighbors, it randomly chooses one, carves a path to it, marks it visited, and pushes it onto the stack. If the current cell has no unvisited neighbors (it's a dead-end), it backtracks by popping cells from the stack until it finds a cell with unvisited neighbors. The process ends when the stack is empty. It tends to produce mazes with long corridors.

3.  **BinaryTreeGenerator (Binary Tree Algorithm)**:
    *   **Mechanics**: For each cell in the grid, this algorithm randomly decides to carve a passage either North or West (or in this implementation, Down or Right). It iterates through each cell and makes this choice. If the chosen direction is blocked by the boundary, it carves in the other available direction. This is a very simple and fast algorithm but results in mazes with a strong diagonal bias (e.g., all passages leading towards North-West or South-East).

4.  **EllersGenerator (Eller's Algorithm)**:
    *   **Mechanics**: Eller's algorithm processes the maze row by row. In each row, cells are randomly joined into sets. For each cell, it decides whether to merge it with the cell to its right, provided they are not already in the same set. After processing horizontal connections, it makes vertical connections downwards. For each set, at least one cell must have a passage leading down to the next row, ensuring all sets are connected. The last row is treated specially: all adjacent cells not in the same set are joined to prevent isolated passages.

5.  **HuntAndKillGenerator (Hunt and Kill Algorithm)**:
    *   **Mechanics**: This algorithm has two phases. It starts with a "walk" phase: begin at a random cell, mark it visited, and randomly choose an unvisited neighbor, carve a path, and move to it. This continues until the current cell has no unvisited neighbors. Then, the "hunt" phase begins: scan the grid cell by cell. Look for an unvisited cell that is adjacent to a visited cell. If found, carve a path from the adjacent visited cell to this unvisited cell, and this new cell becomes the starting point for the next "walk" phase. If the hunt phase scans the entire grid and finds no such cell, the maze is complete.

6.  **KruskalGenerator (Kruskal's Algorithm)**:
    *   **Mechanics**: This algorithm is adapted from Kruskal's algorithm for finding minimum spanning trees. It initializes each cell as its own set. All potential walls between cells are added to a list and then shuffled. The algorithm iterates through the shuffled walls. For each wall, if the two cells it separates belong to different sets, the wall is removed (a passage is carved), and the sets of the two cells are merged. If they are already in the same set, the wall is left intact to avoid cycles. This continues until all walls are processed.

7.  **RandomizePrimsGenerator (Randomized Prim's Algorithm)**:
    *   **Mechanics**: It starts with a grid full of walls. A starting cell is chosen, marked as part of the maze, and added to a "frontier" list of cells. While the frontier list is not empty, a cell is randomly selected from it. All unvisited neighbors of this cell are identified. One is randomly chosen, a path is carved to it, and this neighbor is added to the frontier list. If the selected frontier cell has no unvisited neighbors, it is removed from the frontier. The algorithm ends when the frontier list is empty.

8.  **RecursiveDivisionGenerator (Recursive Division Algorithm)**:
    *   **Mechanics**: This algorithm starts with an empty space (or a space with only outer walls) and recursively divides it. In each step, it chooses a chamber and divides it by adding a wall either horizontally or vertically at a random position. A single passage is then opened at a random position in this new wall. This process is applied recursively to the sub-chambers created until the chambers are too small to divide further. This method creates mazes with long, straight walls.

9.  **SidewinderGenerator (Sidewinder Algorithm)**:
    *   **Mechanics**: The Sidewinder algorithm processes the grid row by row. For each cell in a row, it decides whether to carve a passage to its eastern neighbor or to "close off" the current run of eastward passages. If it continues east, the passage is made. If it closes the run (or if it's at the eastern boundary), it carves a passage northward from one randomly chosen cell within the current run of cells. For the first row, it always carves east until the end, then carves no passages north.

10. **WilsonGenerator (Wilson's Algorithm / Loop-Erased Random Walk)**:
    *   **Mechanics**: Wilson's algorithm starts by choosing a random cell and marking it as part of the maze (visited). Then, another random unvisited cell is chosen as the starting point for a random walk. The walk continues until it encounters a cell that is already part of the maze. If the walk path intersects itself (forms a loop), the loop is erased from the path before continuing. Once the path reaches a visited cell, the entire loop-erased path is carved into the maze, and all cells in this path become visited. This process repeats until all cells are visited. It produces an unbiased sample from all possible mazes.

**Common Implementation Patterns:**

Across the 10 Swift implementations, several common patterns were observed:

1.  **Protocol Adherence**: All classes correctly conform to the `AnimatedMazeGenerator` protocol, implementing `width`, `height`, `grid` properties, and the `generateSteps() -> AsyncStream<MazeStep>` method.
2.  **Grid Initialization**: `GridUtility` (e.g., `GridUtility.initMaze()` or `GridUtility.initMazeWithOddIntersections()`) is consistently used for creating the initial grid. The choice of utility function depends on whether the algorithm works better with a grid of cells and interstitial walls or a grid of nodes and edges.
3.  **Asynchronous Stream for Animation**: `AsyncStream { continuation in Task { ... } }` is the universal mechanism for emitting `MazeStep` data, allowing for step-by-step visualization. `continuation.finish()` is called to signal the completion of the generation.
4.  **Centralized Cell Update**: A `Coordinate.updateCell(in: &grid, continuation: continuation, type: ...)` extension method is commonly used. This method handles changing the cell's type in the `grid` data structure and `yield`ing a `MazeStep` to the stream for animation.
5.  **Use of Randomness**: Standard Swift randomness features like `randomElement()` on collections (for selecting cells, neighbors, or directions) and `Bool.random()` (for binary decisions) are pervasively used, which is fundamental for maze generation.
6.  **Neighbor Logic**: A `Coordinate.findNeighbors(...)` extension method (with parameters to filter by type or direction) is frequently used to identify adjacent cells relevant to the algorithm's current step.
7.  **Animation Pacing**: `Task.sleep(nanoseconds: Constants.animationStepDelay)` is consistently used within loops to control the speed of the animation, making the generation process observable.
8.  **Coordinate System**: All algorithms operate on a "doubled" grid representation where actual maze cells/nodes are typically at odd coordinates (e.g., (1,1), (1,3)) and the walls/passages between them are at coordinates involving at least one even number (e.g., (1,2) is the wall between (1,1) and (1,3)).

**Key Implementation Variations:**

While common patterns provide a consistent framework, significant variations arise from the distinct nature of each algorithm:

1.  **Initial Grid State**:
    *   Most algorithms start with a grid full of walls and carve paths.
    *   `RecursiveDivisionGenerator` is an exception, starting with an open grid (all paths) and then adding walls.
2.  **Core Algorithmic Structure & Data Structures**:
    *   **Stack-based (DFS behavior)**: `BacktrackingMazeGenerator` uses an array `[Coordinate]` acting as a stack.
    *   **Set-based (Frontier or Unvisited Tracking)**: `RandomizePrimsGenerator` uses a `Set<Coordinate>` for its frontier (`openCells`). `WilsonGenerator` uses a `Set<Coordinate>` for `unvisited` cells.
    *   **Path/Walk Tracking**: `WilsonGenerator` uses a `[Coordinate : Coordinate]` dictionary (`walkPath`) to store and erase loops in its random walks.
    *   **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**: `KruskalGenerator` implements a `UnionFind` struct. `EllersGenerator` uses a custom `EllerSetManager` struct to manage cell sets within rows.
    *   **List of Walls/Edges**: `KruskalGenerator` generates a list of all potential walls and shuffles it.
    *   **Row-by-Row Processing with Local State**: `SidewinderGenerator` maintains a `run: [Coordinate]` for the current segment of cells in a row. `BinaryTreeGenerator` and `EllersGenerator` also operate row by row with specific logic for each.
3.  **Control Flow**:
    *   The primary control flow mechanism varies: `while` loops are common for algorithms that continue until a state is met (e.g., stack empty, all cells visited). `for` loops are used for systematic iteration (e.g., over all cells/rows, or a list of walls).
    *   `RecursiveDivisionGenerator` uniquely uses recursion for its divide-and-conquer strategy.
4.  **Cell Update Type**:
    *   Most generators change `CellType` to `.path` when creating passages.
    *   `RecursiveDivisionGenerator` primarily changes `CellType` to `.wall` as it adds barriers.
5.  **Dimensional Adjustments**:
    *   `RecursiveDivisionGenerator` and `WilsonGenerator` explicitly convert input `width` and `height` to odd numbers (`.toOdd`) to align with their grid logic requirements, ensuring cells and walls are placed correctly on the doubled grid structure.

This analysis demonstrates a well-architected system within RabbitMaze where diverse maze generation algorithms are implemented by leveraging shared utilities while preserving their unique logical structures and behaviors.
